# FORM + CODE: Random Dancing

Loosely inspired by https://icarly.fandom.com/wiki/Random_Dancing !

In Random Dancing, we explore the idea of computer-generated randomness working in tandem with human/visual intuition. The "human" element comes into play with hand-drawn animations, while randomness dictates the color scheme, positioning of elements, and animation speed (frame rate).
